## KEY LEARNINGS:

* Data Cleaning:
This is like tidying up before guests arrive. In the data world, it's about fixing errors, making sure everything is in a format and handling missing values according to the data because null values should not be replaces with Mean, median, Mode values everytime.

* Descriptive statistics:
Think of it as painting a picture of your data with numbers. Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset, giving you a quick snapshot of what's going on.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
This is the Sherlock Holmes phase. EDA is where you dig into your data, searching for patterns, trends, and relationships. It's about understanding the story your data wants to tell you.

* Feature Engineering:
Turning plain ingredients into a gourmet dish! Feature engineering is all about creating new, more informative variables from the raw data. It's like adding secret spices to make your model perform better. Sometimes the data we are working with might not give accurate resluts so we might need to create new variables in order to get more genuine resluts.

* Detecting Outliers:
Finding the rebels in your data. Outliers are the data points that break the mold, and detecting them helps you understand if there's something genuinely interesting going on. This might be something which stands out of all others and seems to be something we are looking for.

* Box Plot:
Visualizing the spread of the data. A box plot shows you the distribution of a dataset, highlighting the central tendency, variability, and potential outliers. 

## CONCLUSION:

We concluded the analysis by recommending **LEICESTER CITY**!

They have a proven track record of **success and consistency**. We believe that this club is well-positioned for success in the future.
